# When


An OSX calendar visualisation utility. Based around the idea of an iteractive dial-clock. Calendar events are
displayed in the dial space. The user can use this space to manage existing events, add new ones etc.


A collaborative effort with Miran Križanić (friend, room-mate, designer, architect), somewhere during 2009. Our
idea was to launch the project on iOS, but never got around to making the port.
